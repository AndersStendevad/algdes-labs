# algdes-labs

Programming exercises for algorithm design.

These files are used for my classes in algorithm design.
Each lab contains a subdirectory for data files.
A report skeleton in latex is contained in the doc subdirectory.
For my classes, you are welcome to ignore the latex source and do the whole report by hand or in whatever obscure word processor you want.

     /data
     /doc/report.tex
     
At some time in the future, the lab descriptions themselves will migrate to the doc directories as well.
